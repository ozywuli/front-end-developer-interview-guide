## Benefits of type

- eliminates undesirable code from being run (by being pruned during compile time)
- reality itself is typed (you cant add lengths to weight and vice versa)
- adding two lengths of different units will cause a compile error
-

## Benefits

- optional static typing
- type inference: omit irrelevant types
- access to the latest JS features
- compile down to a version of JS that runs on all browsers
- improve tooling (intellisense)
- helps modify old codebases with more confidence
- useful reference: less time figuring out what upstream API provides in terms of payload and return types

### optional static typing

- can be added to variables, functions, properties...
- help the compiler show warnings about potential errors before code is ever run
- when using libraries and frameworks, lets developers know exactly what type of data APIs expect
- optional!

### type inference

- TypeScript is smart enough to guess what a variable's type might be

### intellisense

- provide code hints and code completion
- provide all methods available and what they expect as arguments
