- hyper text transfer protocol
- the protocol for the World Wide Web defines how messages and formatted, transmitted, and received
- stateless: each command is executed without any knowledge of the commands that came before
- status codes with success or errors
- HTTPS encrypts messages between the browser and the server through a SSL or TSL certificate
- the website stores a private key and sends a public key to the receipient. whenever the recipient wants to send something to the website, that something is scrambled with a public key, which makes it near impossible for a middleman to decipher the message. only the person with the private key can decipher the user sent message + public key
