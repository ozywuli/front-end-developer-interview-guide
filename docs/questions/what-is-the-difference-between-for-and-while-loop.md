## For

Use the for loop when you know the number of iterations


```js
for ( let i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

## While

Use the while loop when you don't know how many iterations you need to make.

```js
while (incomplete) {


    break;
}
```

## Do While

Use the do... while loop to make you iterate at least once no matter the condition


```js
do {

} while (incomplete)
```
