Within a functional scope, all variable declarations are hoisted to the top, meaning variables can be used before their formal declaration. In other words, a variable declared anywhere in a function exists throughout the entire function and its value is undefined until it's assigned a value. Therefore, the best practice is to declare all variables at the top.
