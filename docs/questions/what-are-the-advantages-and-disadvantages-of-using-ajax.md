# What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Ajax?

## Advantages
- Make partial updates without refreshing the page, creating a more seamless experience for users
- Maintain state between pages, such as music playing in the background or a video thumbnail playing in the corner
- Display realtime data

## Disadvantages
- Complexity of your app increases, thus more development time and troubleshooting
- not handling ajax errors can mess up your app
- not SEO friendly by default
- creates issues for screenreaders
- Larger code size means users have to download and unbundle more code before page is visible (bad for mobile)
