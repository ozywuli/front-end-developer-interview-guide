## Expressions

- produce a value
- 

## Statements

- perform an action
- e.g. `if` and `loop` statements
- end with semicolons


## General

- Expressions can be written wherever statements can be written. They are **expression statements**
```js
var x = 5; // expression statement
x = 5 // expression
```
- but you cannot write statements where an expression is expected. `if` statements cannot be used as arguments in a function
- Anything that can be used as a value is an expression
