- pointers to next and prev nodes
- can operate as stacks and queues

Advantages (over array)
- store items of different sizes
- grows organically (array size needs to be known ahead of time or recreated when it grows)
- constant time insertions and deletions
- shuffling a list change what points to what

Disdvantages (against array)
- linear lookup (array indexes are trivial)


Examples
- Redux middleware
- Express middleware
- Gulp
