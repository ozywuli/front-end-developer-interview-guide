- Consists of a recursive part that calls itself and a base case that doesn't (breaking out of the recursive calls)
- when a fn calls itself, it pushs new `execution context` to the `execution stack`
- when base case is met, the stack unwinds as context is popped off one by one (last in first out or FIDO)
