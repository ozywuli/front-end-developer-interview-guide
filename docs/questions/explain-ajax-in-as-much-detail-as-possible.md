- Ajax is an async technique where a request is made to a server using javascript. The server responds with a payload that JS can then consume. Usually there's more code that takes that payload and updates the DOM with the data so that the browser doesn't have to refresh the page. This makes for a snapper user experience and improves overall performance.
- Updates a web page without reloading it
- request data from a server after a page has loaded
- receive data from a server after a page has loaded
- send data to the server in the background
- receive data from the server in the background
