What is a higher-order component?

- A component that takes another component and returns a new component
- What it doesn't do...
    - it doesn't modify the input component
    - doesn't use inheritance to copy an input component's behavior
- Wraps additional behavior around an input component

2 Concepts to Understand
1. Functions as first class objects -> functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments in function paramaters, and returned from functions - just like strings, arrays, and objects
2. callbacks -> function passed as an argument is a "callback"
