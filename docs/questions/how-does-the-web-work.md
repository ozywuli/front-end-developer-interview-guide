The web is a service built on top of the internet.

The client requests information from the server

- Internet connection: allows you to send and receive data on the web (the road)
- TCP/IP: Defines protocols or ways data should be communicated over the web (the car/bike) (the postal service)
- DNS: Address book for websites
- HTTP: Protocol for how client and server should communicate (using language to order goods or provide a service) (the business letter format or any other format)
- Component files: code (HTML, CSS, JS) and assets (images, videos, audio, documents)
