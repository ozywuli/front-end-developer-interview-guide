Tips

- letterMap stores mapping between letters in 1st string and 2nd string
- Returns false if string lengths are different
- Returns false if letterA exists in the letterMap but whose property value is not equal to letterB
- Returns false if letterA doesn't exist in the letterMap but attempts to map to a letterB value that has already been mapped
